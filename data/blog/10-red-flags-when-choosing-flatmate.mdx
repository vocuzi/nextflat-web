Selecting a roommate is like entering in a mini-marriage. You are sharing bills, space, routines, and often a fair portion of your personal life. Get it right and you will have someone feeling like family. Get it wrong, and each day could seem to be a slow-burning disaster. Whether you recently moved to a new city or are new to shared living, early red flag spotting will help you avoid a lot of stress.

These ten red flags should help you to be alert while selecting a roommate:

## 1. **They are too eager to move in without asking questions**

It's worth stopping if someone seems unduly desperate to lock in a place and doesn't show much interest about rent, rules, or even you. Like you are, a good roommate should be equally fascinated about the arrangement. Someone rushing in could be hiding a messy past, including unpaid bills or past evictions.

## 2. **They Steer Clear of Money**

Though they may feel embarrassing, discussions on rent split, utility bills, and how expenses will be managed are vital. It could cause problems down the road if your prospective roommate becomes evasive or contemptuous when money comes up. You want not to be left at the end of the month carrying the bag.

## 3. **Ex-Roommate Horror Stories Too Many**

One thing is to have a negative experience with a roommate—that is inevitable. Red flags abound, though, if someone talks endlessly about "psycho" ex-flatmates and how _everyone else_ was the problem. The common denominator might not be the other people.

## 4. **Dubious Employment Situation**

Richness is not something you need from a roommate; but, stability is something you do need. There is risk if their source of income seems dubious, varies daily, or they avoid the question entirely. Two months in that they have stopped paying rent is not something you want to know.

## 5. **Their Lifestyle is a Dramatic Mismatch**

On weekdays, they party until 4 AM; you are an early riser that enjoys quiet evenings. Alternatively you prefer things neat and view "cleaning" as an annual event. Lifestyle choices are fine, but without mutual respect or compromise, things will get messy—literally and emotionally.

## 6. **Too Many "House Rules" Right Out of Hand**

Having boundaries is wonderful, but if your potential roommate starts rattling out a long list of strict rules in your first meeting—no guests ever, specific food schedules, or rules about _how_ to use the bathroom—it could be a sign of a controlling or rigid personality. A shared house should feel like a shared space.

## 7. **Their Social Media Says Different**

Though everyone of us shows somewhat different versions of ourselves online, there are some obvious discrepancies. It's worth asking more questions if they claim to be quiet and low-key yet their feed is full of wild celebrations. It's about making sure you're on the same page, not about judgment.

## 8. **They Trash Talk the Neighbors or Landlord without Invitation**

First impressions are important. Should your prospective roommate continue to criticize the landlord or other tenants prior to even moving in, it could indicate that they already intend to cause disturbance—or have a habit of assigning blame to others for their own problems.

## 9. **They Show Indices of Being Entitled or Disrespectful**

There are small signals that matter. Are they constantly interrupting you? Do they move about your space as though they already own it? During the tour, do they disregard your choices? Respect in shared living is not negotiable. Should it not exist from the beginning, typically things do not get better later.

## 10. **Your Gut Says Something Is Not Right**

Though it seems nebulous, this is most likely the most crucial one. If something feels off—perhaps they are just uncomfortable, dodging questions, or they are simply too charming—you should trust that instinct. Living with someone calls for trust, thus pay attention if your gut is sounding quiet alarms.

## Reflective Notes

Though they should be someone who respects your space, balances their weight, and is easy to live with, a great roommate does not have to be your friend. Although initially it may seem like a chore, spending time properly vetting someone will help you avoid daily headaches (and possibly some embarrassing situations) down road.

Ask questions, be clear about your expectations, and never settle just because you're in a hurry—in doubt. The ideal roommate is well worth the wait.
